# Enhanced Sceduly

Background... My daughter's faculty uses [Sceduly](https://sceduly.com/) to enable students to show when and where their classes, laboratories, etc... are.

Students are divided into groups. However, each student, within the same year, sees all the classes and laboratories of all the groups in [Sceduly](https://sceduly.com/) which makes it unreadable and unusable.

This [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) user script enables selective hiding and displaying, filtering, of schedule items in [Sceduly](https://sceduly.com/) based on lecture title and group.

Script can be installed via [OpenUserJS Enahnced Sceduly](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/tomy2105/Enhanced_Sceduly).

**Disclaimer:** use at your own risk and double check your schedule, author is in no way responsible for missed classes :)!!!
